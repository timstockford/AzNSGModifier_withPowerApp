## Submitting Issues & Pull Requests
This is intended to be a private hobby project to serve a specific purpose, but also to serve as a reference example for others to use/learn from freely.  However if you wish to report an issue (and then optionally) submit a pull request then I will consider these at my leisure, and at my own descretion choose to implement or close issues & pull requests.
